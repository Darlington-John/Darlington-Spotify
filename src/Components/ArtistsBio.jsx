          With the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier
          Than Ever,’ the 21-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the
          biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her
          debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015, Eilish continues to shatter the
          ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her
          humble breakout, her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?
          debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17
          additional countries around the world upon release in 2019, and was
          the most streamed album of that year. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE
          DO WE GO? was written, produced and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish
          and brother FINNEAS in their childhood home of Los Angeles. Billie
          Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive
          nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY®
          Awards, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year,
          Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie
          Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official
          James Bond theme song, ‘No Time To Die.’ Most recently, Billie Eilish
          was nominated for four additional awards at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY
          Awards in 2021, and took home both Record of the Year for 'everything
          i wanted,' and Best Song Written For Visual Media for 'No Time To
          Die.’ Billie Eilish’s latest album ‘Happier Than Ever’ was written by
          Billie and her brother FINNEAS, who also produced the album.
