        Harry Styles’ third solo album, Harry's House, is breaking new ground
        for one of the most creative forces in pop music, a star who keeps
        refusing to stand still. It’s a deeply personal statement from an artist
        who has never sounded this joyous, this confident, this fearless in
        facing the future. Harry’s House debuted at Number One on the Billboard
        Charts and moved 521,00 equivalent album units in its first week.
        Harry's House is currently the best-selling album of 2022. “As It Was,”
        the critically acclaimed lead single, dropped on April 1st and became an
        instant record-breaking hit, debuting at Number One in both the U.S. and
        the U.K. “As It Was” became the most-streamed song in the U.S. in a
        single day in Spotify history and the most-streamed song globally in a
        single day of 2022. The British singer-songwriter dropped his
        blockbuster sophomore album Fine Line on Columbia Records in December
        2019. It combined critical acclaim with record-setting commercial
        success, debuting at Number One on the Billboard charts. “Watermelon
        Sugar” became his first Number One single, winning Styles his first
        Grammy, for Best Pop Solo Performance and a 2021 BRIT Award for Best
        British Single. When Rolling Stone released its comprehensive list of
        the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Fine Line was the most recent album
        honored, taking its place in history. Harry is taking Love on Tour
        worldwide through 2022, in the aftermath of his historic Coachella set,
        in support of Harry’s House.

        Diamond-certified American hitmaker Post Malone bridges the gap between
        the worlds of rap and the pop mainstream. Within five years of his
        debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar,
        amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined
        his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production
        inspired as much by as . After the release of his 2015
        quintuple-platinum single "White Iverson," off his debut, Stoney, he
        quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with
        a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers
        "Rockstar" with and "Psycho" with from 2018's Grammy-nominated Beerbongs
        & Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history,
        "Sunflower" with , from 2019's pop-leaning Hollywood's Bleeding. After
        dialing things back with 2022's vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he
        made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023's Austin. Raised in
        Dallas, loved a wide range of music from a young age and planned on
        joining a band thanks to the video game Guitar Hero. When his dad gave
        him a copy of 's hit "Lean Back," though, Post decided to become an MC.
        He hung out with the Dallas crew the IRAS until a move to the West Coast
        dropped him in Los Angeles. After putting some braids in his hair, he
        coined the term "White Iverson," and when he posted the track in early
        2015, he hit a million views within a month. Post signed with the label
        later that year. In 2016, he released the single "Go Flex" along with
        his official debut mixtape, August 26th. Months later, his first studio
        effort arrived. Stoney featured guests ranging from to ' to , peaking at
        number four on the Billboard 200 and later achieving multi-platinum
        certification. Following the success of his debut, Post issued the
        chart-topping singles "Rockstar" with and "Psycho" with , which reached
        a combined total of 13-times platinum. Those hit tracks landed on his
        sophomore follow-up, Beerbongs & Bentleys, which dealt with his rapid
        climb to fame and all its trappings. The set reached number one upon
        release and was later nominated for Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammy
        Awards. Along with producers , , , and , the dark, introspective affair
        also featured guest rappers , , and , as well as the additional radio
        hit "Better Now."

        Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (/ˈsiːə/ SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an
        Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she
        started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the
        mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio
        album, OnlySee, in Australia. She moved to London and provided vocals
        for the British duo Zero 7. Sia released her second studio album,
        Healing Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, Colour the Small One, in
        2004. Sia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States.
        Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and
        We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were
        certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and
        attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her
        growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing and focused on
        songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations
        "Titanium" (with David Guetta), "Diamonds" (with Rihanna), and "Wild
        Ones" (with Flo Rida).

        As the frontman for , Thom Yorke provides the band with a humanistic
        focus: his keening, emphatic vocals balance even the group's chilliest
        moments. However, other than duets with similarly inclined artists (, ),
        Yorke resisted venturing into solo recordings until 2006's The Eraser,
        which further plumbed the depths of 's most experimental electronic
        efforts. He has continued to maintain that focus in his work outside the
        band, whether it's through subsequent solo albums, soundtrack
        contributions, original scores such as 2018's Suspiria, or his project
        co-starring and . Yorke was born on October 7, 1968, in Wellingborough,
        England. His left eye was paralyzed from birth and remained shut until
        the age of six. He underwent a total of five operations; the last
        operation was botched and he almost lost all sight in that eye. Only
        after wearing an eye patch for a year was he able to see, albeit
        slightly. His family moved often since his father worked as a
        chemical-engineering instruments salesman, and by his teens, he had
        turned to music as an inspiration, namely , , and . After his family
        finally settled down in Oxford, Yorke was sent to an all-boys school,
        where he met future guitarist and bassist , soon after discovering such
        '80s alternative bands as , , and . The seeds of what became were
        planted at this point, as the trio jammed with a drum machine before
        replacing it with another friend, drummer , and inviting 's younger
        multi-instrument-playing brother to join up, too. The group's original
        name was On a Friday before being changed to , which they'd swiped from
        the title of a song on ' True Stories. By late 1991, the band was signed
        to in the U.K. and in the U.S., as an EP, Drill, came and went without
        much fanfare. Released in 1993, the group's full-length debut, Pablo
        Honey, appeared to be suffering the same fate until American radio/MTV
        made a surprise hit out of the -esque alternative anthem "Creep." 's fan
        base grew considerably over the course of their next two releases,
        1995's The Bends and 1997's OK Computer, the latter being voted Greatest
        Album of All Time in the British magazine Q shortly after its release.
        One of the world's top rock bands by this time, attempted to alienate
        their newly found Top 40 audience with their next release, 2000's
        abstract Kid A, but instead found it debuting at the top of the U.S.
        charts (despite the absence of a video or single being released from the
        album).

        Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged
        and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs
        that earned them grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope
        by hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their
        fanbase with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single
        “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past
        hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best
        Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to
        see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart
        upon its release in early 2015. For Imagine Dragons, one of the greatest
        achievements of Evolve is its unfettered honesty. “Instead of hiding
        behind metaphors, I was able to be more direct in my lyrics,” says
        Reynolds. “I really focused on searching deeper for lyrical value.”
        Along with giving the album untold emotional depth, honesty cuts through
        everyday chaos to reveal a luminous truth. “Right now the world can seem
        like a very dark and daunting place,” says Reynolds. “We wanted to
        create something like a lot of the records we grew up on, where it feels
        like you’re escaping into a world that’s much more vibrant. Our hope is
        that the album helps people focus on the beauty of each moment, and
        really see all the brilliance and color of life.”

        Twenty One Pilots - GRAMMY® Award-winning Twenty One Pilots quietly
        emerged as one of the most successful bands of the 21st century and
        redefined the sound of a generation. After billions of streams and
        dozens of multi-Platinum certifications around the world, the
        history-making Columbus, OH duo—Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun—ascended to a
        creative and critical high watermark on their latest full-length album,
        Scaled And Icy. The album debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top “Rock
        Albums” and “Alternative Albums” charts, while landing at No. 3 on the
        “Billboard 200,” marking the biggest opening week for a rock album in
        2021. Scaled And Icy follows Twenty One Pilots’ 2018 Platinum certified
        album TRENCH, which features the platinum singles: “Chlorine,” “My
        Blood,” and the GRAMMY® Award-nominated “Jumpsuit.” Certified
        quadruple-platinum in the U.S., the mainstream breakout of 2015’s
        BLURRYFACE, was declared the first album ever to have every one of its
        songs certified Gold or Platinum by the RIAA, and garnered a GRAMMY®
        Award for the Diamond certified “Stressed Out.” In 2019 Twenty One
        Pilots announced that their 2013 LP Vessel achieved the same Gold &
        Platinum milestone with every individual track from the album receiving
        Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum certification from the RIAA, making the
        duo the first artist / group with two albums to reach this landmark
        achievement.

        Diamond-certified American hitmaker Post Malone bridges the gap between
        the worlds of rap and the pop mainstream. Within five years of his
        debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar,
        amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined
        his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production
        inspired as much by as . After the release of his 2015
        quintuple-platinum single "White Iverson," off his debut, Stoney, he
        quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with
        a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers
        "Rockstar" with and "Psycho" with from 2018's Grammy-nominated Beerbongs
        & Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history,
        "Sunflower" with , from 2019's pop-leaning Hollywood's Bleeding. After
        dialing things back with 2022's vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he
        made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023's Austin. Raised in
        Dallas, loved a wide range of music from a young age and planned on
        joining a band thanks to the video game Guitar Hero. When his dad gave
        him a copy of 's hit "Lean Back," though, Post decided to become an MC.
        He hung out with the Dallas crew the IRAS until a move to the West Coast
        dropped him in Los Angeles. After putting some braids in his hair, he
        coined the term "White Iverson," and when he posted the track in early
        2015, he hit a million views within a month. Post signed with the label
        later that year. In 2016, he released the single "Go Flex" along with
        his official debut mixtape, August 26th. Months later, his first studio
        effort arrived. Stoney featured guests ranging from to ' to , peaking at
        number four on the Billboard 200 and later achieving multi-platinum
        certification. Following the success of his debut, Post issued the
        chart-topping singles "Rockstar" with and "Psycho" with , which reached
        a combined total of 13-times platinum. Those hit tracks landed on his
        sophomore follow-up, Beerbongs & Bentleys, which dealt with his rapid
        climb to fame and all its trappings. The set reached number one upon
        release and was later nominated for Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammy
        Awards. Along with producers , , , and , the dark, introspective affair
        also featured guest rappers , , and , as well as the additional radio
        hit "Better Now."

        became a platinum-certified viral streaming hit. They have since notched
        up over two billion streams, appeared on James Corden and Jimmy Kimmel,
        and toured the world to strikingly diverse audiences, from Glastonbury
        to Primavera and Red Rocks to Coachella. Bayley figured that most bands’
        second albums are informed by life on the road, for better or worse, so
        instead of writing about himself, why not tell the stories of some of
        the fascinating people they met? Each song on 2016’s Mercury-shortlisted
        How to Be a Human Being explore a different character until the
        overwhelming final track, Agnes, when Bayley turned the camera on
        himself. Around the same time, Bayley started writing and producing for
        other artists, including Joey Bada$$, Flume, 6lack, Wale, Khalid and, on
        last year’s Tokyo Drifting, Denzel Curry. Third album Dreamland was
        recorded in London in 2019, produced by Bayley and mixed by David
        Wrench, Manny Maroquin and MixedbyAli. Glass Animals’ most enthralling
        album to date, it’s a pop record of rare scope, vision and emotional
        depth.

        Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (/ˈsiːə/ SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an
        Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she
        started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the
        mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio
        album, OnlySee, in Australia. She moved to London and provided vocals
        for the British duo Zero 7. Sia released her second studio album,
        Healing Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, Colour the Small One, in
        2004. Sia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States.
        Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and
        We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were
        certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and
        attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her
        growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing and focused on
        songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations
        "Titanium" (with David Guetta), "Diamonds" (with Rihanna), and "Wild
        Ones" (with Flo Rida).

        Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged
        and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs
        that earned them grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope
        by hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their
        fanbase with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single
        “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past
        hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best
        Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to
        see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart
        upon its release in early 2015. For Imagine Dragons, one of the greatest
        achievements of Evolve is its unfettered honesty. “Instead of hiding
        behind metaphors, I was able to be more direct in my lyrics,” says
        Reynolds. “I really focused on searching deeper for lyrical value.”
        Along with giving the album untold emotional depth, honesty cuts through
        everyday chaos to reveal a luminous truth. “Right now the world can seem
        like a very dark and daunting place,” says Reynolds. “We wanted to
        create something like a lot of the records we grew up on, where it feels
        like you’re escaping into a world that’s much more vibrant. Our hope is
        that the album helps people focus on the beauty of each moment, and
        really see all the brilliance and color of life.”

        A Moroccan-American rapper who built an indie empire with his Cocaine
        City imprint, French Montana rose from the New York mixtape underground
        in the 2000s to emerge as a pop-savvy hip-hop artist in the 2010s.
        Starting with his 2013 debut album, Excuse My French, he became known
        for his high-profile collaborations and a handful of chart hits
        including "Unforgettable" from his platinum-certified 2017 sophomore LP,
        Jungle Rules. 2019's double album Montana was another showcase for
        big-name guests that featured the hit singles "No Stylist" and "Writing
        on the Wall." He retained his tried-and-true formula in 2021 for another
        guest-heavy effort, They Got Amnesia, before collaborating with on
        2022's Montega and on 2023's Coke Boys 6. Born Karim Kharbouch in
        Morocco, he immigrated to the U.S. while in his teens. He set up shop in
        the Bronx and began releasing his Cocaine City series of DVDs in 2002,
        mixing interviews with established hip-hop artists and unsigned talent.
        In 2009 he began releasing his own mixtape CDs with DJs like , , and as
        his hosts. That same year, he would be signed to 's label, but in late
        2011 it was announced that they had parted ways and that Montana was
        signing to both 's and ' imprints in a unique joint venture. His 2012
        single "Pop That" would be the first release for the united labels,
        while 2013 saw the arrival of his debut album, Excuse My French.

        Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (/ˈsiːə/ SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an
        Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she
        started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the
        mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio
        album, OnlySee, in Australia. She moved to London and provided vocals
        for the British duo Zero 7. Sia released her second studio album,
        Healing Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, Colour the Small One, in
        2004. Sia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States.
        Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and
        We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were
        certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and

        Harry Styles’ third solo album, Harry's House, is breaking new ground
        for one of the most creative forces in pop music, a star who keeps
        refusing to stand still. It’s a deeply personal statement from an artist
        who has never sounded this joyous, this confident, this fearless in
        facing the future. Harry’s House debuted at Number One on the Billboard
        Charts and moved 521,00 equivalent album units in its first week.
        Harry's House is currently the best-selling album of 2022. “As It Was,”
        the critically acclaimed lead single, dropped on April 1st and became an
        instant record-breaking hit, debuting at Number One in both the U.S. and
        the U.K. “As It Was” became the most-streamed song in the U.S. in a
        single day in Spotify history and the most-streamed song globally in a
        single day of 2022. The British singer-songwriter dropped his
        blockbuster sophomore album Fine Line on Columbia Records in December
        2019. It combined critical acclaim with record-setting commercial
        success, debuting at Number One on the Billboard charts. “Watermelon
        Sugar” became his first Number One single, winning Styles his first
        Grammy, for Best Pop Solo Performance and a 2021 BRIT Award for Best
        British Single. When Rolling Stone released its comprehensive list of
        the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Fine Line was the most recent album
        honored, taking its place in history. Harry is taking Love on Tour
        worldwide through 2022, in the aftermath of his historic Coachella set,
        in support of Harry’s House.

        Diamond-certified American hitmaker Post Malone bridges the gap between
        the worlds of rap and the pop mainstream. Within five years of his
        debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar,
        amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined
        his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production
        inspired as much by as . After the release of his 2015
        quintuple-platinum single "White Iverson," off his debut, Stoney, he
        quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with
        a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers
        "Rockstar" with and "Psycho" with from 2018's Grammy-nominated Beerbongs
        & Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history,
        "Sunflower" with , from 2019's pop-leaning Hollywood's Bleeding. After
        dialing things back with 2022's vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he
        made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023's Austin. Raised in
        Dallas, loved a wide range of music from a young age and planned on
        joining a band thanks to the video game Guitar Hero. When his dad gave
        him a copy of 's hit "Lean Back," though, Post decided to become an MC.
        He hung out with the Dallas crew the IRAS until a move to the West Coast
        dropped him in Los Angeles. After putting some braids in his hair, he
        coined the term "White Iverson," and when he posted the track in early
        2015, he hit a million views within a month. Post signed with the label
        later that year. In 2016, he released the single "Go Flex" along with
        his official debut mixtape, August 26th. Months later, his first studio
        effort arrived. Stoney featured guests ranging from to ' to , peaking at
        number four on the Billboard 200 and later achieving multi-platinum
        certification. Following the success of his debut, Post issued the
        chart-topping singles "Rockstar" with and "Psycho" with , which reached
        a combined total of 13-times platinum. Those hit tracks landed on his
        sophomore follow-up, Beerbongs & Bentleys, which dealt with his rapid
        climb to fame and all its trappings. The set reached number one upon
        release and was later nominated for Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammy
        Awards. Along with producers , , , and , the dark, introspective affair
        also featured guest rappers , , and , as well as the additional radio
        hit "Better Now."

        Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (/ˈsiːə/ SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an
        Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she
        started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the
        mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio
        album, OnlySee, in Australia. She moved to London and provided vocals
        for the British duo Zero 7. Sia released her second studio album,
        Healing Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, Colour the Small One, in
        2004. Sia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States.
        Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and
        We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were
        certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and
        attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her
        growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing and focused on
        songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations
        "Titanium" (with David Guetta), "Diamonds" (with Rihanna), and "Wild
        Ones" (with Flo Rida).

        Juice WRLD became a Top Ten hitmaker delivering introspective lyrics
        atop melodic production, with echoes of and . His heartsick 2018 debut
        Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), home to his biggest hit "Lucid Dreams,"
        reflected a wide range of stylistic influences: R&B instrumentation,
        dreamy beats, and even indie rock melodicism. The momentum built by
        "Lucid Dreams" helped land Juice's sophomore effort, 2019's A Death Race
        for Love, at the top of the charts. Months later, at the height of his
        mainstream popularity, he tragically passed away after suffering a
        medical emergency at Chicago's Midway Airport; he had just turned 21. At
        the time of his death, Juice had three singles in the Hot 100 and both
        official LPs in the Top 100. Posthumously released material like 2021
        album Fighting Demons would continue to top the charts years after his
        passing. Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park musician grew up
        playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high
        school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from and , Higgins
        began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut,
        which resembled 's in the film Juice. His early tracks were all posted
        online, leading up to 2017's Juice WLRD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira
        and Sidepce, the set included the singles "Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)" and
        "All Girls Are the Same." Both tracks would also land on his official
        debut full-length, Goodbye & Good Riddance (), which peaked at number 15
        on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018. In January 2019 Higgins
        issued the single "Robbery" ahead of the arrival of the full-length A
        Death Race for Love, which was released later that March. Death Race
        shot to number one on the Billboard 200 and was soon certified gold. He
        followed with high-profile collaborations with ("Hate Me"),
        ("Graduation"), ("All Night"), and ("Bandit"). In 2019, the latter track
        joined "Lucid Dreams" as the rapper's second Top Ten hit.

        It’s hard to imagine that a girl growing up with a love for video games
        and an early interest in the violin would ultimately turn into the
        global phenomenon and crossover sensation artist that is Taylor Davis. A
        self-admitted “proud nerd” and still an avid gamer, her unique
        arrangements of many of gaming, anime and film’s most iconic soundtracks
        have been viewed over 300 million times by her delighted audience of
        over 2 million YouTube subscribers. Ever since then, Taylor’s amazing
        journey has included her personally mastering a wide range of audio and
        video technologies to produce her art, the establishment of her own
        independent music label, and the creation of an incredibly strong bond
        with her legion of loyal listeners who are inspired by her positivity,
        passion and authentic connection to the music that they love so much.
        Her latest of eight full length albums titled “Odyssey” (which she
        composed, produced and mixed by herself in her home studio) continues to
        build on the success of her prior work, debuting at #6 on the Billboard
        Chart for classical music. A frequent live performer, Taylor has
        headlined tours in the U.S. and Europe, and has appeared at numerous
        anime and game themed conventions, industry events and colleges. On the
        receiving end of bullying throughout many of her early school years,
        Taylor also serves as an Ambassador for the “I Am A Witness” campaign
        against bullying, helping others to overcome many of the challenges that
        she faced growing up.
